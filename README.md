# Preact TS with Bun runtime

This is a simple template for starting a Preact project bootstrapped with [bun](https://bun.sh/), with TypeScript instead of the default JavaScript configuration.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repo

To create a TS Preact project with bun:

```sh
bun create johanneslil/bun-preact-ts ./bun-preact-ts-app
```

To create a regular JS Preact project with bun:

```sh
bun create preact ./bun-preact-app
```

### Development

First, run the development server.

```
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
